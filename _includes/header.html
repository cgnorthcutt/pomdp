            Ayy! I'm PomDP the PhD rapper. I'm an artist, producer, and scientist based in Boston. I was born and raised in Kentucky and I'm the only PhD rapper, hence the name.  I'm finishing up my PhD at MIT in artificial intelligence in 2020.

I love rap more than anything. I've got bars, but I don't rap about shit I don't actually do in real life. But I do rap differently: Sometimes I mix up the content with my MIT-side: creating machines that can think,  reaching your potential, tech industry, grad school.

Being a rapper, I'm giving up a lot! I'm getting a PhD from the best damn school in the world and every minute I make music, I'm not solving problems I could solve with my PhD. Why??? Because I have a vision... people all over the world listening to dope rap music that over time expose them to places like MIT, higher education, working at Facebook, and growing up poor and getting out. Also I just really love rapping. This is my dream. Help me make it come true.
